A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) server that enables AI agents to read, search, and extract content from PDF files. Built with Python and PyMuPDF, with SQLite-based caching for persistence across server restarts.

**mcp-name: io.github.jztan/pdf-mcp**

## Features

- **7 specialized tools** for different PDF operations
- **SQLite caching** — persistent cache survives server restarts (essential for STDIO transport)
- **Paginated reading** — read large PDFs in manageable chunks
- **Hybrid search** — combines BM25 keyword (FTS5) and semantic (local embeddings) via Reciprocal Rank Fusion; falls back to keyword-only without `pdf-mcp[semantic]`
- **Image extraction** — per-page images returned as PNG file paths alongside text
- **Table extraction** — per-page tables with header and row data, detected via visible borders
- **URL support** — read PDFs from HTTP/HTTPS URLs

## Installation

```bash
pip install pdf-mcp
```

For semantic search (adds `fastembed` and `numpy`, ~67 MB model download on first use):

```bash
pip install 'pdf-mcp[semantic]'
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Desktop</strong></summary>

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pdf-mcp": {
      "command": "pdf-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Config file location:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

<details>
<summary><strong>Visual Studio Code</strong></summary>

Requires VS Code 1.102+ with GitHub Copilot.

**CLI:**
```bash
code --add-mcp '{"name":"pdf-mcp","command":"pdf-mcp"}'
```

**Command Palette:**
1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Run `MCP: Open User Configuration` (global) or `MCP: Open Workspace Folder Configuration` (project-specific)
3. Add the configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "pdf-mcp": {
         "command": "pdf-mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
4. Save. VS Code will automatically load the server.

**Manual:** Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "pdf-mcp": {
      "command": "pdf-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Codex CLI</strong></summary>

```bash
codex mcp add pdf-mcp -- pdf-mcp

Or configure manually in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.pdf-mcp]
command = "pdf-mcp"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Kiro</strong></summary>

Create or edit `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` in your workspace:

  }
}
```

Save and restart Kiro.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Other MCP Clients</strong></summary>

Most MCP clients use a standard configuration format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pdf-mcp": {
      "command": "pdf-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

With `uvx` (for isolated environments):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pdf-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["pdf-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
pdf-mcp --help
```

## Tools

### `pdf_info` — Get Document Information

Returns page count, metadata, file size, and estimated token count. **Call this first** to understand a document before reading it. Includes `toc_entry_count` and inline TOC entries when the document has ≤50 bookmarks; larger TOCs (e.g. slide decks) return `toc_truncated: true` — use `pdf_get_toc` to retrieve the full outline.

```
"Read the PDF at /path/to/document.pdf"
```

### `pdf_read_pages` — Read Specific Pages

Read selected pages to manage context size. Each page dict includes `text`, `images`/`image_count`, and `tables`/`table_count`. Tables are extracted as structured data (header + rows) and inlined directly in the page response — no separate tool call needed. Table detection requires visible borders in the PDF.

```
"Read pages 1-10 of the PDF"
"Read pages 15, 20, and 25-30"
```

### `pdf_read_all` — Read Entire Document

Read a complete document in one call. Subject to a safety limit on page count.

```
"Read the entire PDF (it's only 10 pages)"
```

### `pdf_search` — Search Within PDF

Find relevant pages before loading content. The default mode is **hybrid** — Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) merges BM25 keyword results and semantic embedding results into a single ranked list. This consistently outperforms either method alone: keyword search finds exact terms that embeddings miss; semantic search finds conceptual matches that keyword search misses; RRF fusion captures both.

Three modes are available:

- **`mode="auto"` (default)** — Hybrid RRF when `pdf-mcp[semantic]` is installed; keyword-only fallback otherwise.
- **`mode="keyword"`** — BM25/FTS5 only. Best for exact identifiers, product codes, precise terms.
- **`mode="semantic"`** — Semantic only (requires `pdf-mcp[semantic]`). Best for conceptual queries.

Response includes `search_mode: "hybrid" | "keyword" | "semantic"` indicating which path ran.

The first call on a new document embeds all pages (one-time cost, ~291ms for 200 pages); subsequent calls are instant.

```
"Search for 'quarterly revenue' in the PDF"
"Find pages about revenue growth in the PDF"
"Which pages discuss supply chain risks?"
```

### `pdf_get_toc` — Get Table of Contents

```
"Show me the table of contents"
```

### `pdf_cache_stats` — View Cache Statistics

```
"Show PDF cache statistics"
```

### `pdf_cache_clear` — Clear Cache

```
"Clear expired PDF cache entries"
```

## Example Workflow

For a large document (e.g., a 200-page annual report):

```
User: "Summarize the risk factors in this annual report"

Agent workflow:
1. pdf_info("report.pdf")
   → 200 pages, TOC shows "Risk Factors" on page 89

2. pdf_search("report.pdf", "risk factors")
   → Relevant pages: 89-110

3. pdf_read_pages("report.pdf", "89-100")
   → First batch

4. pdf_read_pages("report.pdf", "101-110")
   → Second batch

5. Synthesize answer from chunks
```

## Caching

The server uses SQLite for persistent caching. This is necessary because MCP servers using STDIO transport are spawned as a new process for each conversation.

**Cache location:** `~/.cache/pdf-mcp/cache.db`

**What's cached:**

| Data | Benefit |
|------|---------|
| Metadata | Avoid re-parsing document info |
| Page text | Skip re-extraction |
| Images | Skip re-encoding |
| Tables | Skip re-detection |
| TOC | Skip re-parsing |
| FTS5 index | O(log N) search with BM25 ranking after first query |
| Embeddings | Instant semantic search after first indexing run |

**Cache invalidation:**
- Automatic when file modification time changes
- Manual via the `pdf_cache_clear` tool
- TTL: 24 hours (configurable)

## Configuration

Environment variables:

```bash
# Cache directory (default: ~/.cache/pdf-mcp)
PDF_MCP_CACHE_DIR=/path/to/cache

# Cache TTL in hours (default: 24)
PDF_MCP_CACHE_TTL=48
```

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jztan/pdf-mcp.git
cd pdf-mcp

# Install with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Type checking
mypy src/

# Linting

```

## Why pdf-mcp?

| | Without pdf-mcp | With pdf-mcp |
|---|---|---|
| Large PDFs | Context overflow | Chunked reading |
| Token budgeting | Guess and overflow | Estimated tokens before reading |
| Finding content | Load everything | Hybrid search — RRF fusion of BM25 keyword (FTS5) + semantic embeddings; never misses what either alone would |
| Tables | Lost in raw text | Extracted and inlined per page |
| Images | Ignored | Extracted as PNG files |
| Repeated access | Re-parse every time | SQLite cache |
| Tool design | Single monolithic tool | 7 specialized tools |
